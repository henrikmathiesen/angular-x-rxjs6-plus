<h2>Understanding and creating Observables</h2>
<p>
    An <mark>Observable</mark> is a representation of any set of values over any amount of time.
</p>
<h3>Observers</h3>
<p>
    An <mark>Observer</mark> is observing the data the Observable produces. They implement the observer interface,
    which has the methods <mark>next() , error() and complete()</mark>
</p>
<p>
    The methods corresponds to the 3 types of messages an Observable can produce:
    They push the next value in the data stream to their observer with next, 
    if the get an error they call the error message and when done producing values they call complete.
</p>
<h3>Subscribers</h3>
<p>
    Objects that want to recieve values from an Observable are passed to a method named subscribe()
</p>
